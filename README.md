# Association-Rule-Learning-Market-Basket-Analysis
Implementation and testing of algorithms for Market Basket Analysis

# Currently has: Apriori Algorithm Implementation
This repository contains a working Apriori implementation for frequent itemset mining
and association rule generation.

**Notes:**
- Fully functional and tested on sample data.
- Uses support, confidence, and lift.
- Candidate generation is simple (joins with 1-itemsets).  
  Future improvements could include:
  - Joining (k-1)-itemsets for efficiency
  - Preprocessing transactions as sets
  - Optimized data structures for large datasets
